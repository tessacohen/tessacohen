                <p class="copy " font face='open-sans' z-index:1>The story of the Chicago Cubs that we know and love today begins in 1876. Chicago’s most beloved team joined the National Association of Professional Baseball, under the name of the White Stockings. They quickly became considered one of
                    the earliest powerhouses in the league after winning 6 titles in their first 11 years of participation. </p>
                <p class="copy ">A key player from this era was Adrian “Cap” Anson. His record breaking career and dedication to the team led him to hold a management position for a total of 19 years. He got his nickname, “Cap” from his captain and father-like relaitonship
                    that he had with the team. </p>
                <p class="copy ">After more than several successful seasons, the team changed their name to the Colts from 1890 to 1897. The Colts was changed to the Orphans in 1897 when “Cap” Anson retired from working for the franchise. That same year, the Chicago Daily
                    News referred to them as the “Cubs.” This nickname came from the young age of majority of the team. It stuck with them until 1907 when it was adopted as the official name.</p>
                <div class="year-right"><b>1907</b></div>
                <p class="copy ">The Cubs then set a record for 116 wins, while in the same year, lost the World Series in game 6. The following season, in 1907, they won 107 games and went on to win the World Series against the Detroit Tigers. The following year, they
                    won their second World Series title. </p>

            <p class="copy ">In 1910, the team went to the World Series and lost in game 5 to the Philadelphia Athletics. There were big losses in their roster when some major key players left. There were some changes that happened to their team, including moving to Chicago’s
                North Side park, now known as Wrigley field.</p>
            <p class="copy ">In 1918, they made it to the World Series and lost to the Boston Red Sox. This was the start of a 4 time consecutive losing streak in the World Series.</p>
            <p class="copy ">In 1945, they made it to the World Series once again. They won the first 3 games, but during the 4th, and final game, they lost. During this game, the owner of Billy Goat Tavern had his goat with him at the game. He was asked to leave the
                premises due to the awful smell that his goat had. This was the start of the Curse of the Billy Goat that would keep the Cubs out of the World Series for another 71 years.</p>
            <p class="copy">For most sports branding, no matter what outstanding advertising is done, the ultimate factor on whether or not a fan base buys (tickets, merchandise, etc.), is dependent on how the team plays. However, the Chicago Cubs are most known for being this exception.</p>
            <p class="copy">This is when the brand turned into being nicknamed the “Lovable Losers.” At this point, losing the game was inevitable. The game day experience turned into something so much more. It turned Chicagoans into a loyal fanbase who would buy rooftop
                bleacher tickets game after game to enjoy the summer weather, eat a delicious Chicago style hot dog along side an ice cold beer, and all to support their very own Cubbies.</p>

            <p class="copy ">Much of the credit on how the Cubs successfully sold this brand experience to customers is due to Phillip K. Wrigley. He was owner of the Wrigley Chewing Gum company and the Chicago Cubs. In 1937 he begun this process with planting ivy in the outfield, which is now considered the iconic staple of the ballpark. The next steps included significantly increasing advertisements that entirely excluded information about the games itself. If the team wasn't going to win on the field, the marketing team knew their best shot for success would have to come from everything else.</p>
            <p class="copy">Throughout the years, they went through logo changes, stadium embellishments and several different attempts to rebrand and find their "selling" angle for the franchise.</p>
            <p class="copy">Throughout this time period, the expectations were set fairly low considering their trackrecord. But because of hall of famers, Gabby Hartnett (1955), Ernie Banks (1977), Billy Williams (1987), and Fergie Jenkins (1991), cubs fans had a few excitement filled games over the years.</p>
            <p class="copy">In the 1980s, there were several changes in the foundations of the team. It started in 1881 with the change of ownership from 65-year long relationship with the Wrigley family, to the Tribune Company. Seven short years later was Wrigley Field's first night game. This attraction led to renovations that included 60+ mezzaine suites and a new press box.</p>

            <p class="copy">In the new decade, changes in management lead to a very hopeful fanbase. With a new President at the start of the 2011 season Theo Epstein, began working towards turning around the future of the Cubs. He worked with Jed Hoyer, the general manager, to begin rebuilding a winning team. In 2016 the Cubs had an incredible record. A season that was better than what was ever expected.</p>
            <p class="copy">The team was led by MVPs, Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo. With their astonishing hard work and dedication, they won 103 games. After a long 71 years, the drought was quickly forgotten when the Cubs became National League champions and World Series champions for the first time in <b>108 years.</b></p>
            <p class="copy">This meant that the "Lovable Losers" were no longer. The Cubs were quick to "FLy the W". Now that they are an entirely new Cubs from what they branded for many years, the marketing team had to rethink and explore the new possiblities. It was finally a time that was even better than imagined, some would even consider it to be <b>the greatest moment in franchise history. </b>And that is when "That's Cub" marketing slogan was created. This slogan stands for the positivity and loyal, yet rewarding, journey. It is no longer about the negative stereotypes of the expected losses and curses. Since the unforgettable year and the game that changed the Chicago Cubs franchise forever, there has never been more opportunity for rebranding and defining the new Chicago's favorite sports team.</p>
